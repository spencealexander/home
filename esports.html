			<p>Soon after Rocket League was released, it became an officially sponsored eSport, with support from the <a href="https://www.eslgaming.com/" target="_blank">Electronic Sports league (ESL)</a> and <a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/" target="_blank">Major League Gaming (MLG)</a>. After Rocket League became popular on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a>, a video game live-streaming service, Psyonix created their own <a href="http://www.rocketleagueesports.com/" target="_blank">Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS)</a>.</p>

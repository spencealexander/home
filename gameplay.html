			<p>The objective of Rocket League is to use the player's car to score on the opposing team. Players can jump with their cars to hit the ball while in the air. Players can also collect speed boosts across the field, which once activated will allow players to quickly cross the field, add momentum to the ball, or destroy other players. Players can also perform dodges, causing their car to quickly spin in a given direction, which can be used to gain positioning advantage over the opponent.</p>

			<p>Matches typically are 5 minutes long, with 10 second intermissions when each goal is scored. If the score is tied at the end of the 5 minutes, the game enters a sudden death mode where the first team who scores wins. Matches can be played with or against a computer-generated player or online players, with 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 game-modes available.</p>

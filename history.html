		<h3><a id="sarpbc">SARPBC</a></h3>
			<p>Before Rocket League, Psyonix had developed a game titled "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars", in which players use cars to shoot a ball into the opponent's net. SARPBC was officially released for the Playstation 3 on February 12, 2009.</p>

			<br/>
			<p>Although the game sold over 2 million copies, it was not a successful project. However, SARPBC had a small yet dedicated fan base that offered ideas for a sequel to the game. These contributions sparked the idea of Rocket League.</p>
		<h3><a id="development">Main Development</a></h3>
			<p>The development of the sequel of SARPBC, Rocket League, started in 2013. The entire project costed under $2 million to develop. Pysonix used critical feedback from SARPBC to fine-tune the sequel, for example increasing the max frame-rate, making the game more appealing to new players, and adding customizable toppers, boosts, and antennas. Psyonix had also replaced SARPBC's hosted web servers with Rocket League's own game servers, allowing cross-platform gameplay and reducing ping. The name "Rocket League" was selected with a vision of reducing the title length from its predecessor, making it more marketable.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Rocket League was officially announced as the sequel of SARPBC in 2014. Pysonix partnered up with Youtube and Twitch.tv video game streamers to help spread the word about their upcoming game. Rocket League released for Windows and PS4 on July 7, 2015, and on Xbox One on February 17, 2016.
